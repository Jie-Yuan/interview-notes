## Chapter 10 (Sorting and Searching):
* external sorting -> naive vs min-heap for [k-way merging][1]
* searching -> think modified binary search
* 2**10 = 1024 ~= 10**3
* bit vectors are great!
* think KiB not KB
* input/output verification
* matrix binary search -> mind blown
* if example data is given, USE IT IT PROBABLY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE/HAS HINTS
* bsts -> good at maintaining relative ordering after insertion -> array vs bst
insertion
* rephrase problem in own words -> what does it really mean to be a peak ->
max of 3

## Chapter 8 (Recursion and DP):
* think fib example -> recursive, memo, bottom up memo
* modified bin search is great!
* think through each approach, once you know it's a recursion problem, i.e.
can i do bottom up approach i.e. base case and build, top down or half and
half? now how do i improve -> add memo or even memo bottom up
* definitely need more practice on this topic

## Chapter 4 (Trees and Graphs):
* kahn's algo -> topo.sort

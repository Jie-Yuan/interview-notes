# DS

## LL vs Arrays/Lists:
* random access
* consecutive memory
* use combo to implement hashtable aka dict from scratch

## Hash Table:
* chaining, linear and quadratic probing

## Queues:
* BFS

## Stacks:
* DFS

## Trees:
* **complete bin**: every level full except last is left to right
* **full bin**: zero or two
* **perfect bin**: full & complete
* inorder trav = LPR -> order refers to P
* deletion in bst -> 3 case -> 0, 1, and 2 children (succesor)

## Tries:
* prefix trees
* prefix checking complexity is `O(k)` i.e. same as hash table

## Heaps:
* build from list: perc down from middle to root aka all nodes with children

## AVL:
TODO

## Red-Black:

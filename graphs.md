# Graphs

# Representation:
* objects/pointers = OO implementations -> vertex attributes
* adj. list = **sparse** -> memory `O(V+E)`, time `O(1)`/`O(V)`
* adj. matrix = **dense** -> memory `O(V**2)`, time `O(1)`

# Bidirectional Search:
* BFS at source and destination = `O(k**(d/2))`

# BFS & DFS:
* shortest paths and finishing times, respectively
* to get time complexity, think in aggregate

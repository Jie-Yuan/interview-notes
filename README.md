# Interview Prep Notes

## What are these?
These are my SWE/ML interview prep notes. They can be cryptic and
that is because they are **not meant to teach others**, they are meant to help me
remember and process what I have learned.

## Why post them on Github then?
It is easier for me to access my notes across devices(desktop, laptop, etc).
